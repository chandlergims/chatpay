              <p>
                When you send a message to another user, a small SOL fee (shown on their profile) 
                is temporarily held in escrow. This fee is based on the recipient's set rate.

                returned to you automatically. This ensures you only pay for actual responses.

                You can set your message rate when creating your profile or by editing your 
                existing profile. Navigate to your profile settings and adjust the "Message Rate" 
                slider to your desired amount.

              <p>
                No, only the receiver can delete messages. If the receiver deletes a message before 
                responding, your SOL fee will be automatically refunded to your wallet. If they've 
                already responded, the fee has been transferred to them and cannot be refunded.

              <h3>Is there a minimum or maximum message rate?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, the minimum message rate is 0.01 SOL and the maximum is 1.00 SOL. 
                This range ensures fair pricing while preventing abuse of the system.

                Payments are processed immediately when you send a response. The SOL will 
                appear in your wallet within seconds of your response being delivered.
